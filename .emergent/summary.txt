The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the Oupafamilly Counter-Strike 2 tournament platform from an initial, partially functional state to a robust, production-ready application. Key work involved resolving initial environment and configuration issues, specifically an outdated backend URL. Major feature implementations included a comprehensive tournament detail page, a team registration system allowing team creation and selection, and a dynamic tournament bracket with score tracking. Significant effort was dedicated to UI readability and display logic for participant/team names and winners. The engineer also addressed critical bug fixes like the tournament deletion and participant validation. The work culminated in extensive enhancements to the community page, user profiles, and administrative team management, alongside a refactor of tournament templates for CS2 2025 maps. The engineer concluded by addressing user feedback on UI elements and implementing new core functionalities.

<product_requirements>
The Oupafamilly application is a full-stack platform designed for Counter-Strike 2 tournaments. Initially, the application, despite having a sophisticated backend and a modern React frontend, required significant functional and UI improvements.

**Implemented Features:**
1.  **Tournament Detail Page:** Resolved the issue of an empty tournament detail page, implementing a full display of tournament information, rules, and participants.
2.  **Team System & Registration:** Built a comprehensive system for team management, allowing users to select existing teams or create new ones during tournament registration.
3.  **Bracket Generation & Live Score Tracking:** Implemented automatic random bracket generation upon tournament start and an interface for score/winner updates, with a full admin panel for live tracking.
4.  **UI Readability:** Addressed text contrast issues on white backgrounds, particularly in modals and organizer sections, through extensive CSS adjustments.
5.  **Displaying Real Names/Teams:** Ensured correct display of participant names for 1v1 tournaments and team names (with member count) for team tournaments, including within the bracket.
6.  **Winner Display Bug:** Fixed the vainqueur TBD bug, ensuring the correct winner's name is displayed.
7.  **Team Membership & Management:** Allowed team creators to be moderators, adding/removing members, and enabling users to join multiple teams. Automatic team suggestions during tournament registration were added, with mandatory team selection for 2v2/5v5 tournaments.
8.  **Admin Team Management:** Implemented an admin interface to manage and delete teams.
9.  **Tournament Deletion Fix:** Corrected the bug preventing tournament deletion for admins.
10. **Participant Validation:** Enforced participant count to be a multiple of 2 for 2v2 tournaments and 5 for 5v5.
11. **Updated Tournament Templates:** Replaced Aim Challenge with a 2v2 Competitive template and updated all templates with official CS2 2025 Active Duty maps.
12. **Content Management:** Created a new News page and added administrative options to delete news articles and tutorials.
13. **Community Page & Profiles Refinements:** Removed the message option for members, ensured the profile button navigates correctly, and added search functionality for members and teams.
14. **Join Call-to-Action:** Replaced candidater with nous rejoindre buttons which now open the registration modal.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of implementing the user account deletion and password modification by email features.

The backend endpoints for these functionalities were successfully added to .
-   A new endpoint for  was added, allowing users to remove their accounts.
-   Endpoints for  (to send an email with a reset link) and  (to update the password using a token) were added.

The very last action in the trajectory was the confirmation of the successful backend edit to , and the next planned step was to create the frontend interface for these functionalities by adding buttons to the  page. This indicates that the backend work for these features is complete, and the focus has shifted to integrating them into the frontend. The  file is the current point of focus for the frontend implementation.
