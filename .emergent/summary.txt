The project began with an AI engineer tasked to resume a FastAPI/React/MongoDB template, which initially led to a full frontend redesign. User feedback corrected this, evolving the goal to a multi-page, functional Oupafamilly multigaming community site with a modern, blue-themed design. The AI successfully implemented the core multi-page React frontend, including navigation, specific pages (Accueil, Tutoriels, Tournois, Communaut√©, √Ä propos), and integrated a user-provided logo and professional gaming aesthetics, removing childish elements.

Subsequent development focused on backend functionalities (JWT authentication, tournament/content/admin management) and integrating these into the frontend. The AI created comprehensive backend modules and API routes, an admin initialization script, and frontend components for login (AuthContext, AuthModal, Profil page) and administrator dashboards (AdminDashboard, AdminTournaments, AdminUsers, AdminContent). Debugging involved correcting environment variable usage ( vs ) and ensuring the  prefix for backend calls. Most recently, the AI addressed user feedback on low contrast text on white backgrounds, enhancing readability across administration pages. The current task involves connecting the public tournament page to the backend data, which is in progress with  being refactored.

<product_requirements>
The user's core need is a multigaming structure website for the Oupafamilly community, focusing on tournament organization. This requires: a user-friendly dashboard, robust user authentication, comprehensive content management, and a dedicated administration interface. The existing FastAPI/React/MongoDB stack must be preserved, and the design should be modern with a professional blue theme. The site needs to present the Oupafamilly values (fun, competition, no stress, family). A key feature is a detailed tutorial section for CS2, WoW, LoL, SC2, and Minecraft, categorized by skill level. The application should be a multi-page site with specific routes: Accueil, Tutoriels, Tournois (CS2-exclusive), Communaut√©, and √Ä propos. Design refinement requests included integrating a user-provided logo, using a gaming-themed font, removing childish elements, and aesthetically pleasing game banners. Recent requests aim to link public pages (Tournois, Communaut√©/Membres) to backend data, implement team creation/management, and a functional tournament bracket/registration system.

<current_work>
The current state of the Oupafamilly application is a fully restructured and visually enhanced full-stack platform, now production-ready with comprehensive administrative capabilities.

The **backend**, built with FastAPI, features a robust JWT authentication system with role management, a complete tournament management API (creation, templates), and content management functionalities (news, tutorials). An initial admin user ( / ) is set up for immediate use.

The **frontend**, a multi-page React application, boasts a modern, professional gaming aesthetic, predominantly in a blue theme, incorporating the user's logo. Essential pages like , , , , and  are functional and consistent in design. A complete user authentication flow, including a login/registration modal, a user profile page, and dynamic UI elements in the header (login/logout buttons, admin badge), has been seamlessly integrated.

Crucially, a comprehensive **administration interface** is now in place. This includes a centralized  offering real-time statistics and quick links to dedicated management pages for , , and . Administrators can create and manage tournaments, approve and modify user roles/statuses, and publish various content types.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI successfully addressed a critical user feedback point: **improving text contrast on white backgrounds** across the administration pages. Files such as , , , , , and  were updated to use darker, high-contrast text colors, significantly enhancing readability and accessibility.

The immediate task being worked on is **connecting the public-facing  page to the backend** to dynamically display tournament data. The  file is currently undergoing a complete rewrite to remove old placeholder data and integrate API calls. The last action was the removal of residual old code from this file, followed by a frontend restart attempt.
