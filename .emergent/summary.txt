<analysis>
The previous AI engineer initiated the project by analyzing an existing FastAPI/React/MongoDB template. Initially, the user requested to reprendre the project, leading the AI to mistakenly replace the entire frontend with a new design. After user feedback, the AI attempted to restore and incrementally improve the original, but this also failed to fully meet the user's expectation of retaining previous credits.

The user then explicitly requested a completely new, multi-page, 100% functional site with a modern design. The AI successfully implemented this, creating distinct React pages (Accueil, Tutoriels, Tournois, Communauté, À propos) and a professional blue-themed UI. Subsequent user feedback focused on aesthetics (childish logos/emojis), content specifics (CS2-only tournament page, tutorial banners), and the integration of a user-provided logo. The AI promptly integrated the logo, refined the design for a professional gaming look, removed emojis, and structured the pages according to new content requirements. The last task involved fixing centering issues on the Communauté and À propos pages, which was addressed with code changes and new CSS.

<product_requirements>
The user initially sought to resume an existing project, evolving into a detailed request for a multigaming structure website focused on tournament organization. Key requirements include: easy dashboard management, user authentication, content management, and an administration interface. The user explicitly desired to retain the existing FastAPI/React/MongoDB structure and favored a modern design with a blue theme. Specific content includes: presenting the Oupafamilly community, emphasizing values like fun, healthy competition, no stress, and a family spirit. A crucial feature is a tutorial section covering CS2, World of Warcraft, League of Legends, StarCraft 2, and Minecraft, organized into beginner, intermediate, and expert levels. The final iteration of requirements specified a new multi-page site (Accueil, Tutoriels, Tournois, Communauté, À propos) with a professional, clean gaming design, integration of a user-provided logo, a gaming-themed font, removal of childish elements, CS2-exclusive tournament page content, and aesthetically pleasing game banners for tutorials.

<current_work>
The current state of the product is a fully restructured and visually redesigned multi-page React application for the Oupafamilly multigaming community. The site now features a professional, modern gaming aesthetic predominantly using a blue theme, directly inspired by and integrating the user-provided community logo.

The frontend is built with React Router, enabling clear navigation between distinct pages:
*   **Accueil (Homepage)**: Presents the Oupafamilly community with a welcoming title, a hero section with a gaming background, and highlights the community's core values (fun, healthy competition, no stress, family spirit).
*   **Tutoriels**: Structured to categorize tutorials by 5 major games (Counter-Strike 2, World of Warcraft, League of Legends, StarCraft II, Minecraft), each with sections for Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert levels. It's set up to incorporate stylish banners per game.
*   **Tournois**: This page has been specifically tailored to be 100% dedicated to Counter-Strike 2 tournaments, reflecting a tactical/esports design.
*   **Communaute (Community)**: A page placeholder for community content.
*   **À Propos (About Us)**: A page placeholder for the community's story and values.

The previous childish logos and emojis have been replaced by professional graphical elements and a gaming-themed font that harmonizes with the provided logo. The site is designed to be fully responsive.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user complaint that the Communauté and À propos pages were not centered. The AI edited  and  to adjust their content and applied specific CSS rules to ensure proper centering. The last action in the trajectory was initiating a test for these corrected pages. The backend, , remains in its initial template state with basic  and  routes, meaning full authentication, tournament management, and content systems are yet to be implemented on the backend.
